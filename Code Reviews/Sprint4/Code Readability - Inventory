Inventory is very readable, due to the fact that every function to increment or decrement aspects of the inventory is separate. While this may not be the best
practice in terms of quality, it does make it easy to tell what each function is doing and how it is doing it. The only issue I can think of with readability
is that the reader may be confused why there are separate variables for number of bombs, rupees, etc. even though there is an Item List. While we as the developers
know the use, a new reader may need to look through other code files to see how those variables are being used. It may be better to have just a single dictionary,
that holds the ItemEnum type and int amt, that would condense almost the entire file, and may be more intuitive. However, overall this code is very readable.
