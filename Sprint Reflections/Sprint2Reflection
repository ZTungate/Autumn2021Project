Group: Boggus Poggus



  Starting off the project we had a lot of ideas and planned for a lot to get down without a lot of action and accountability throughtout the whole group. This coupled with the entire group procrasting had us off to a late start all around. With a lot of hours being put into the end of the sprint and very few being put into the very start. To the point of 95 commits being put towards the entire project and 75 of those commits happeneing within the last week of the sprint. With this being the first sprint we haven't made any changes but we have already tried to implement changes towards the end of the sprint to become more organized, have better accountability, and better comunication.
