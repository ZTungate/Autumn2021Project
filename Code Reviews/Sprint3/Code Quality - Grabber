Lots of duplicate code across all enemies, most likely would be better served moving this code into an AbstractEnemy class that way you
dont need to make a new initilization for all the fields in the IEnemy interface. IEnemy may be better served not having properties and rather moving
these as variables to the created AbstractEnemy. Duplicate position field in Sprite and Enemy class, this is a recurring problem throughout the project
and position should only be in one or the other.
