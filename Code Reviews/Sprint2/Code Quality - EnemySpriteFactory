Sprint number: 2

Comments on code quality: 
It would be helpful to pass in an X and Y value when you create a new sprite to create a sprite wherever the enemy might move to. 
Very little abstraction of different enemy types so lots of classes.
A possible change to make: 
Add more abstraction to lower down the number of classes for example: SmallEnemey, BossEnemy, LargeEnemy, ThrowingEnemy. 
The current implementation could support this pretty easily by adding some parameters for where to grab the sprite.
