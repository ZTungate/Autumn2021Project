Group: Boggus Poggus

Starting off this sprint we came in with a plan to start earlier in order to avoid the main issues from last sprint.
With that idea in mind we still started later than we should have and will go into sprint4 with a work mentality to get tasks done even sooner in order to avoid the stress of last minute work.
Accountability improved in what was expected of everyone as well as goal tracking by using the projects page on github's website.
Goal tracking can still be improved by having more consistant activity on the page.
