CollisionActions is a very readable class, it has a singular static method that is used to
deal damage to link, each enemy type is clearly defined in its action. The only thing that
may improve this class is to map the EnemyType in a dictionary, that way the method could be much shorter
and you could just call some enemy damage dictionary. It may be wise to move this code though into link itself,
and call it when the enemy collides with link however. But other than that its very readable code.
