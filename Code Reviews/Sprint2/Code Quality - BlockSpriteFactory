Comments on code quality: 
I'm not sure what the CustomMath.MathMod function does, and the customMath.cs file doesn't explain either.
The Create[TILE] functions might benefit from accepting a vector2 so we can place them wherever we want, but otherwise they seem fine.
May be able to combine the Create[TILE] functions into a single create() function that accepts an Enum of the block types and a vector
Overall, the code is very readable and quite simple. The changes I proposed would be fairly easy to implement, since it's really only creating an enum.
