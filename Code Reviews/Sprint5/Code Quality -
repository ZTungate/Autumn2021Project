Name of the .cs file being reviewed: AbstractEnemy.cs (Specifically methods knockback and knockbackMove)

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 10 minutes

This file has reasonably high cohesion, it does not appear to be doing anything unneccssary.
Knockback and KnockbackMove are reasonably simple, they do nothing beyond what is required of them and operate reasonably efficently.
Knockback and knockbackMove both violate the naming convention of having a capital first letter for method names.
The Knockback method is commented, but all coments are single line comments.
