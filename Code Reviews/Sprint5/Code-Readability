The file is quite readable for the amount of complex things that are happening.
One thing that is hard to follow is why the values are chosen for i/j in the for loops.
Some added comments about what some lines are doing would be nice like in the actual generation and telling the percentages in comments.

Other than those changes the file is well organized.
