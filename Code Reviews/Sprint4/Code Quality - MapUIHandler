This file handles the map UI and the location within a room. The code is definitely functional, having tested the game for myself. However, the code could do with comments detailing what
functions do, such as in line 32 which seems to lay out the dungeon layout on the map.
Impressive that the green dot moves in the minimap as Link moves around the room.
One small bug in the code-- the green dot doesn't reach the right edge of the blue map tile, even if link is in the far right of the room.
Overall, well done and impressive functionality. Good job, Mason.
