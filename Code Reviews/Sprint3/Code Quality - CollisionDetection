Comments on code quality:
Variable names are a bit questionable. For instance, rectangles named "One" and "Two" 
Collision names are unclear at first glance. L2E, L2I, etc.
Seems to be a lot of redundance. For instance, detectCollision has overloads for ILink to IEnemy and IEnemy to ILink, which seems to be the same thing. Should remove these if they aren't useful
Overall the code is quite readable. Collision direction is intuitive and comprehensive.
Zach (as the author) is aware that the rect setup logic depends on whether the implementation uses Vector or Rect
