BoomerangProjectile.cs

Quality: The quality of the code is very good, my only change would be to move the myLife variable into the constructor
that way you can modularly change how long you want a boomerang to last depending on certain factors. Possibly obfuscating some code
and moving some methods for the boomerang projectile into an AbstractProjectile class would clean up your code. For example it would remove
the need to implement the get and set for your properties each time you make a new type of projectile.
