Comments on code quality:
There are 19 methods in this class.  A good chunk of them are simple get methods(9).  The variables in this class are straightforward and all used.  
Another good chunk of the methods are simple add methods for the list of enemies items, and blocks.  There are also the corresponding remove methods.
None of the code seems redundent.  For the AddNewBoundingBox method, there is an arbitrary magic number 5 so that the bounding box has an area.  There are plenty of foreach
loops in the code, but none of them are nested.
