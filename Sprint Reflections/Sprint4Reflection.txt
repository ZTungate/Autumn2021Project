Group: Boggus Poggus

This sprint, all of our group members struggled with other assignments. It felt like we didn't have a lot of time to spare for this sprint.
Mason completed a huge portion of the work. I think for this sprint, we had trouble with motivation to do the project. In particular, since Mason spent a lot of time this sprint, he felt burnt out.
We should better plan and spread out the work, so every team member is able to work their best.
