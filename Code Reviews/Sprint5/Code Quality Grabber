Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 

There are some magic numbers that can be moved into const variables or a seperate file to be used.
The loose coupling of grabber not needing link or the room and passing it  off to allow room reseting when grabbed is done well.
It seems like wall movement might still be an issue and logic for it might not be exact to what it's meant to represent.
