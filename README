Program Controls: 
Arrow keys and WASD to move 
O and P to swap enemy
U and I to change items
T and Y to change blocks
Z and N to use sword
1 to throw regular boomerang
2 to throw magic boomerang
3 to fire a regular arrow
4 to fire a blue arrow
5 to place a bomb
6 to cast a fireball
Instead of using mouse controls to change rooms: numpad8 goes north, numpad2 goes south, numpad4 goes west, numpad6 goes east.
Known Bugs:
Multiple key presses with links movement doesn't behave properly.
You can throw many projectiles all at once
Sword beam comes out too fast
Bombs have no collision/spawn weird


We used code metrics to keep track of varying stats about our code base to try and get a general idea of how everything is progressing.
