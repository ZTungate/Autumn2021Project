Comments on code quality: 
I'm not sure what the CustomMath.MathMod function does, and the customMath.cs file doesn't explain either.
The Create[TILE] functions might benefit from accepting a vector2 so we can place them wherever we want, but otherwise they seem fine.
Overall, the code is very readable and quite simple.
