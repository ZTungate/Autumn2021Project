Comments on code quality: 
The player class could benefit greatly from using the state design pattern.
There are some large blocks of commented code, some of which is framework for the state pattern not yet used.
The update class is using several if statements that fall into each other as well as a large nested if statement.
The link/player functionality is working, and the character moves around and uses items as expected.
All in all, could use some cleaning, but functional.
