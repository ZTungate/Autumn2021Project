It was a good idea to make this singleton so that there aren't several soundManagers in existence.
It might be a better idea to have volume be a float value with an increase volume method to increase it between 0-1 in increments of something like 0.1 or 0.01.
It also seems like soundItem is more of a soundManager then soundManager it might be a good idea to have soundManager deal with playing all sounds and have soundItem just be what is being played.
Currently soundManager is only playing the background music which doesn't reflect the name well.
