Comments on code readability:
It looks fine.  The class really only has 2 methods, directionDetect and detectCollision.  directionDetect is well commented.  detectCollision is very straightforward.  
It seems to be heavily overloaded so that it can be called with different object type pairs.  The naming conventions are straightforward and make sense.  
The type names were confusing at first, but then after looking at all of them they made sense.  For example, P2ECollision is a Projectile to Enemy collision type.
