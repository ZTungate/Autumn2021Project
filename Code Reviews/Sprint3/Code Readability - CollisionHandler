Specific comments on what is readable and what is not


Readable: 
fields are self explanatory and well named with maybe renaming collides to collisionList
Needs fixed:
The names of the objects in the for loops could have better naming like ene be renamed to enemy to quickly look at it and know what it is
The abstractDoor collision seems lengthy and has long chains but might be an issue with getting objects over readability itself


Overall: this class has decent readability but the implementations behind it lead to very long chains that go off the screen that can be an issue to read. 
Along with long if statements for checking link states.
