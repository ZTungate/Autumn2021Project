Program Controls: 
Arrow keys and WASD to move 
Z and N to use sword
1 to throw regular boomerang
2 to throw magic boomerang
3 to fire a regular arrow
4 to fire a blue arrow
5 to place a bomb
6 to cast a fireball
Instead of using mouse controls to change rooms: numpad8 goes north, numpad2 goes south, numpad4 goes west, numpad6 goes east.

Known Bugs:
Multiple key presses with links movement doesn't behave properly.
Sword beam comes out too fast
Swords don't explode at the end.
Bombs have no collision/spawn weird
Projectiles don't get deleted on level change.
Sometimes stuck in block with level swapping.
No bounding box where doors should be if there's no door.



We used code metrics to keep track of varying stats about our code base to try and get a general idea of how everything is progressing.
