Comments on code quality:
  This class has 3/5 methods with no implementations. These methods do not need implementations in this
  particular class, so it may be worth looking into moving them elsewhere to improve cohesion of the class.
  The field mySprite could be removed without any consequences since it is only used for assiging link.sprite.
  Aside from these, this class looks fine. It is not very long and everything else seems to do things that need
  to be done.
