Group: Boggus Poggus

Starting this sprint we intended to have most of our bugfixing and polishing the sprint 4 material done by Wednesday 11/24.
We accomplished some cleaning and refactoring in that time, but still faced delays due to the high end of semester workload in all our other classes.
We set more appropriate goals this sprint than we had previously, and gave ourselves a specific deadline to get as much done as possible to prevent procrastination issues.
This was reasonably effective, but there is still room for improvement in ensuring all our work is done on time.
Our goal and time tracking improved this sprint, with most of our work logged in a special channel on our group discord server.
We found this to be more effective than GitHub's native time tracking systems, since it reqired very little extra effort to detail what we did and when.
