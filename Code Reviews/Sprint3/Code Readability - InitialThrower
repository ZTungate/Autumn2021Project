Comments on code readability:
This code is very readable, only a 2 private varaibles which is good, the only thing that might improve readability is to combine the separate
turn methods into one method that uses the command functionality to perform different functions. Having one dictionary and one method would reduce
the total size of this class. While it may be a bit more complex I feel that it will be more readable as we wouldnt have to look specifically at
what each method is doing, even if they are named the same and appear to have the same functionality.
